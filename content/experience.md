## Work Experience

### IT Automation Specialist – [Shell](https://www.shell.ca/)
> *Calgary, AB* <br>
> *Jan 2023 – Present* <br>
> [Projects](/?md=projects-work.md#md-at-shell)

Working in the 'Mobility Retail' business unit (Gas Stations) in the 'Site Systems' team, we were responsible for
ensuring the continuous operation of retail systems software and hardware. In effect, we decide what software is installed
on what hardware, ensure the software is deployed and maintained, and provide the technology to allow field services to 
do their job.

In a Windows only environment, dealing primarily with vendor-proprietary software, we had our hands full. The constant 
struggle of keeping the software updated while balancing downtime with bugfixes, the pain of unreliable vendors, and
the short-notice quick-turn-around nature of compliance requirements brought many challenges to overcome.

    - Orchestrated Azure VM infrastructure using IaC practices.
    - Automated testing of retail site OS deployments in QEMU with Ansible, virsh, and virt-manager.
- Integrate version control and CI/CD practices into existing code bases.
    - Managed Git repositories, building CI pipelines using GitHub Actions for automated testing and releases.
