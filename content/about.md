{t:p img[src='img/mtg.png'], Hi, I'm Cam}


As my LinkedIn tagline describes, I'm a [Calgary-based DevOps guy, Python Dev, Systems Administrator](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-ratchford/).

I grew up in Northern Ontario, and currently reside in Calgary, Alberta.

I love to make things. For a long time now, I've been writing Python applications, playing with digital circuits, and fiddling with the pile of
enterprise IT equipment in my home office. My hobbies have outgrown the spare time I have to spend on them. To get an idea of what all that means,
I advise you to click [here](/?projects.md).
