### Programming Related Interests

- YAML, as data format.
- Templating systems, particularly [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/intro/).
- CLI interfaces, of which I create mostly using [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/).
- Text-based or [TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) interfaces. I've been in the process of making
  a game with [gowid](https://github.com/gcla/gowid) for about a year.
- Vim, especially NeoVim
